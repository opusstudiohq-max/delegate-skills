/**
 * delegate-skills · relay smoke.
 *
 * Drives the relays, unmodified and end to end, against a fake implementer CLI
 * planted on PATH, and asserts the two guarantees they make about runs that do
 * not complete:
 *
 *   1. timeout  — the watchdog kills the implementer's WHOLE process tree and
 *                 result.json reports status "timeout". Driven for the timeout
 *                 matrix on both platforms. On Windows, claude and cursor
 *                 launch a .cmd shim through a serialized cmd.exe invocation,
 *                 while codex/opencode/grok/pi/cline/zcode/commandcode use shell:true. These are exactly the
 *                 cases a plain child.kill would miss; agy, aider, kimi, qoder, vibe, oz, and omp spawn a
 *                 native binary directly — a .cmd stand-in cannot represent them,
 *                 so the smoke compiles a real fake .exe with the C# compiler
 *                 that ships in-box with Windows (no install, no network) and
 *                 puts it on PATH under their names. A POSIX variant repeats
 *                 each run with a parent that complies with
 *                 SIGTERM while its grandchild ignores it — the sweep at close
 *                 must fell the survivor even though the parent's exit
 *                 cancelled the pending escalation timer.
 *   2. aborted  — killing the relay itself still produces result.json with
 *                 status "aborted", and files the implementer flushes during
 *                 the shutdown grace window appear in the refreshed
 *                 touchedFiles. Driven for all sixteen relays on POSIX; Windows
 *                 delivers no catchable SIGTERM, so the scenario cannot be
 *                 driven there (the skill docs carry the same caveat).
 *
 * Every fake answers each relay's version preflight (--version, `version`,
 * `changelog`), and can be told to hang or fail that probe by mode name, so a
 * relay whose preflight is unbounded — wedging before any result.json exists —
 * or which reports a broken CLI as a missing one is caught here.
 * A shared matrix also drives all sixteen through the --timeout values no
 * watchdog can honour — malformed, zero, and past Node's timer ceiling — each of
 * which would otherwise fire on the next tick as a silent instant "timeout".
 * Quick Claude, Cline, Cursor, Qoder, Vibe, Pi, Oh My Pi, and ZCode success cases verify brief
 * delivery, launch arguments, environment handling, and result-event parsing. The
 * timeout/abort cases otherwise run until killed and spawn a subprocess of
 * their own; both assert that this grandchild dies with the implementer.
 * Node built-ins only.
 *
 * Run one module locally: node test/relay-smoke.mjs --only codex
